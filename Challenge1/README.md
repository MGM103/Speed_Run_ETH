# Challenge 1

## Overview  

This challenge is aimed at getting creating a basic staking contract utilising scaffold-eth.
Two contracts have been created `Staker.sol` & `ExampleExternalContract.sol`, the `Staker` contract stakes the ETH deposited in the contract to the
`ExampleExternalContract` contract if certain conditions are met and if they are not met, the users that deposited ETH into the `Staker` contract are
able to withdraw their funds.

This contract and the frontend have been deployed on rinkeby and surge respectively.
